GUI 2 project.

Steps to install:
1. Clone the repository then open it in your editor.
2. cd .\gui2
3. run npm install
4. run npm i firebase@latest (This is because the syntax used vs the firebase version does not match. Updating it fixes this.)
5. run npm start (To start the app and make sure it works.)
